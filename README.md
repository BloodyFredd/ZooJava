# ZooJava
Final project in the AOOP class.
We were instructed to build an application for adding animals to a zoo, using GUI, threads and design paterns we learned at class.

If you would like to see the animals run on your panel, you need to go to IDrawble.java in the grapichs folder and change the "PICTURE_PATH" to the location on your computer of the photos folder.
